# AboutStyle

A minimalistic framework that makes it easy to style small front-end projects with CSS.

## Description

AboutStyle is a CSS framework designed with the intention of providing a simple stylesheet that facilitates the prototyping and development of small front-end projects.

AboutStyle was inspired by excellent frameworks and tools like [Beer CSS](https://www.beercss.com/) and [Master CSS](https://css.master.co/), so you will find styles for the most common HTML elements, as well as basic ready-to-use components. It also includes utility CSS classes for layout, colors, spacing, and dimensions, which you can use whenever you need them.

The philosophy behind AboutStyle is to keep it simple and focused only on the essentials. It doesn't strive to be the most comprehensive CSS framework in the market; it's only meant to be useful for simple prototypes and small personal projects.
